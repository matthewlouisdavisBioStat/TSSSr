Thompson Sampling with Smoothing Splines for Hyperparameter Optimization for R. This package provides the supplementary materials for the dissertation of Matthew Louis Davis University of Iowa (2023), as well as an implementation of the proposed procedure. 

The package is centered around the ``set_optim_thompson" function, which can be applied to ModelSpecification objects in MachineShop package for equipping them with the proposed procedure.
